**Student:** Dylan Miller  
**Course:** CS 499 Computer Science Capstone  
**Institution:** Southern New Hampshire University  
**Term:** Fall 2025  

## About the Project
ToDoInTC is Decided, LLC’s first in-house app, created to consolidate Traverse City, MI events into one user-friendly mobile platform. This capstone project focuses on enhancing the app’s backend services—a distributed event-scraping system that gathers and processes local event data from multiple online sources.

## Project Enhancements
This project improves three major areas of the ToDoInTC backend:

- **Software Engineering & Design:** Implementing Kubernetes-based blue-green deployment for separated development and production environments, with zero-downtime updates hosted on Fly.io.  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Introducing granular container control and a URL flag system that allows selective, efficient event scraping.  
- **Databases:** Adding pre-validation filtering to prevent duplicate event uploads and reduce API token costs by up to 70%.  

Together, these upgrades modernize deployment, streamline scraping logic, and improve data flow efficiency.

## Tech Stack
Python • Docker • Kubernetes • Kafka • PostgreSQL • MongoDB • Playwright • Fly.io

## Source Access
