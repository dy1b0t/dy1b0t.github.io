<h1>CS 499 Capstone – ToDoInTC Enhancement Project</h1>

<p><strong>Student:</strong> Dylan Miller<br>
<strong>Course:</strong> CS 499 Computer Science Capstone<br>
<strong>Institution:</strong> Southern New Hampshire University<br>
<strong>Term:</strong> Fall 2025</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>ToDoInTC is Decided, LLC's first in-house app, created to consolidate Traverse City, MI events into one user-friendly mobile platform. This capstone project focuses on enhancing the app's backend services—a distributed event-scraping system that gathers and processes local event data from multiple online sources.</p>

<h2>Project Enhancements</h2>
<p>This project improves three major areas of the ToDoInTC backend:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Software Engineering &amp; Design:</strong> Implementing Kubernetes-based blue-green deployment for separated development and production environments, with zero-downtime updates hosted on Fly.io.</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures:</strong> Introducing granular container control and a URL flag system that allows selective, efficient event scraping.</li>
  <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Adding pre-validation filtering to prevent duplicate event uploads and reduce API token costs by up to 70%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these upgrades modernize deployment, streamline scraping logic, and improve data flow efficiency.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<p>Python • Docker • Kubernetes • Kafka • PostgreSQL • MongoDB • Playwright • Fly.io</p>

<h2>Source Access</h2>
<p>The private repository is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/dy1b0t/todointc">github.com/dy1b0t/todointc</a> and accessible to the instructor upon request. This public repo contains documentation and enhancement narratives only.</p>

<h2>Portfolio Contents</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Professional self-assessment</li>
  <li>Code review video (10–15 minutes)</li>
  <li>Three enhancement narratives with before/after comparisons</li>
  <li>Pseudocode and flowcharts for each enhancement</li>
</ul>
